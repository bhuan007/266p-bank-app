    <string name="statementContent">In this course project, you will construct a software system that implements a shared specification, identify vulnerabilities in another system that implements the same specification, and then fix vulnerabilities in your own system. You are given a description of a software system, and you have to develop that program (the build phase). Then you inspect the code written from the other teams searching for flaws and vulnerabilities (the evaluate phase). Finally, you collect feedback about your code from other teams, and you try to fix the vulnerabilities (the fix phase).You will take the role of a team of up to 4 developers and experience the different stages (or cycles) of secure software development.In the evaluate phase, we will share the implementations among all teams, and you have the opportunity to find exploitable bugs in the code of all other students. In the third phase, you have the opportunity to fix any discovered bugs. While for this class project, we only pass through the life-cycle once, in practice it is repeated indefinitely due to new features being developed or deeper bugs being found in the existing code.</string>
